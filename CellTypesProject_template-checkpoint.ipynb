    "### Epilepsy in the temporal lobe\n",
    "\n",
    "Epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by prolonged and recurrent seizures. Early autopsies of patients with epilepsy have found that their brains have undergone significant structural changes (Scharfman 2007). The most common form of epilepsy occurs in the temporal lobe and has a prevalence rate of around 0.1%, therefore extensive research has gone into studying the causes of and treatments for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) (Keränen and Riekkinen et al. 1988; Krook-Magnuson et al. 2014). \n",
